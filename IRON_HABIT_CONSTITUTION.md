# IRON HABIT: Scope & Boundary Constitution

> **Mandate**: Iron Habit is a **Cryptographic Discipline Engine**. It exists to translate personal intent into verifiable execution proofs, enforcing "Skin in the Game" mechanics.
> *We govern Commitments, not Intentions.*

## 1. The Boundary Laws

### 1.1 The Positive Constraints (MUST)
*   **Proof of Work**: Every check-in must carry evidence (Metadata, Oracle Sig, or explicit "Honor Pledge" signed by the Sovereign).
*   **Skin in the Game**: A Habit must have a consequence for failure (Staked Reputation, Staked Asset, or Broken Streak).
*   **Protocolized Cadence**: Habits are time-bound (`CRON` logic). "Sometime today" is valid; "Sometime soon" is not.
*   **Binary Outcomes**: You did it, or you didn't. No "Partial Credit" in the Kernel.

### 1.2 The Negative Constraints (NEVER)
*   **No Todo Lists**: We do not track one-off tasks. We track **Recurrency**.
*   **No Vanity Metrics**: "Confetti" must be earned by `Streak > X`. No dopamine hacking without effort.
*   **No Social Spam**: Sharing is "Pull" (Show off trophy), not "Push" (Spam friends to join).
*   **No Infinite Skips**: "Rest Days" must be budgeted (earned), not granted arbitrarily.

## 2. Core Capabilities (In-Scope)

### 2.1 The Daily Protocol (L4)
*   **The Contract**: "I commit to do X every Y."
*   **The Stake**: "If I fail, Z happens" (e.g., Burn 100 Points, Break Streak).
*   **The Oracle**: "Who says I did it?" (Self, Friend, API).

### 2.2 Gamification as Law (L2)
*   **Streaks**: Validated by `DeterministicTime`. A missed window *irrevocably* resets the counter.
*   **Rest Days**: A "Budget" object. You spend a Rest Token to save a Streak.
*   **Trophies**: NFTs (Sovereign Assets) minted upon `Achievement` conditions.

## 3. Approved Evolution Path

1.  **Personal (Now)**: "I commit to myself." (Self-Sovereign Discipline).
2.  **Social (Next)**: "We commit to each other." (Accountability Partners / Squads).
3.  **Institutional (Future)**: "The Team Protocol." (Corporate Cadence / Daily Standups).

## 4. Scope Rulings

| Feature Proposal | Verdict | Rationale |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **"Add a Grocery List"** | **REJECT** | Todo List. Not Recurrent. Not a Commitment. |
| **"Allow 'Skip Day' button"** | **CONDITIONAL** | Only if the user *pays* for it with a pre-earned "Rest Token". |
| **"Share streak to Instagram"** | **APPROVE** | Proof of Work. Social signaling of discipline is valid. |
| **"Edit yesterday's result"** | **REJECT** | **Immutable History**. The window closed. You missed it. |
| **"Link to Strava API"** | **APPROVE** | **Oracle Integration**. High-fidelity proof of work. |
