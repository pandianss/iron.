# IRON-5 CONSTITUTION

## Preamble
We, the Operators of this Kernel, in order to form a more perfect Physics, establish Justice, ensure Domestic Tranquility, provide for the Common Defense, promote the General Welfare, and secure the Blessings of Determinism to ourselves and our Posterity, do ordain and establish this Constitution for the Iron Governance Kernel.

## Article I. Purpose

**The Kernel Purpose Clause:**

> "The purpose of the Iron Kernel is to maintain the **Invariance of Institutional State** through deterministic enforcement of Authority, Budget, and History. Its jurisdiction is limited strictly to the validation of Intents and the mutation of State. It shall never govern User Interface, Workflow Business Logic, or External Integrations, which belong to the domain of the Application Layer (L7)."

## Article II. Jurisdiction

The Kernel holds supreme authority over:
1.  **Identity**: Who is recognized.
2.  **Authority**: What they are allowed to do.
3.  **State**: What is true.
4.  **History**: What happened.

The Kernel disavows authority over:
1.  **Presentation**: How truth is displayed.
2.  **Interpretation**: What truth means to a human (unless codified in Law).
3.  **Suggestion**: What user should do next (Workflows).

## Article III. The Frozen Core

The definitions in `src/L0/Ontology.ts` are the **Supreme Nouns** of the system. No module shall introduce a primitive concept that conflicts with or duplicates these Nouns.

## Article IV. Sovereignty of Time
The Audit Log is the only source of History. History is monotonic; time shall never move backwards. Every state change must be cryptographically linked to its predecessor.

## Article V. Emergency Power (Root Override)
In the event of a Logical Deadlock where the machine's laws prevent a necessary movement of state, the Root Authority (`sys:root`) may exert an **Override**. This bypasses Protocol Law but remains bound by the Laws of Physics (Identity, Budget, Consensus). Every Override must be accompanied by a permanent Justification in the Audit Log.

## Article VI. Foreign Relations
The Kernel is Sovereign within its own domain. It shall not accept assertions from Foreign Kernels unless a formal Treaty (Trusted Public Key) has been ratified. Foreign assertions shall be clearly marked as "Imported" in the State.

## Article VII. Fiscal Law
Budget is not a suggestion; it is a resource constraint equivalent to Physics. No Intent shall be committed if the required Budget (Energy/Risk) is unavailable. The Kernel shall never allow an "Infinite Execution".

## Article VIII. Legislative Process
Code is Law. New laws (Protocols) must follow the lifecycle: `PROPOSED` -> `RATIFIED` -> `ACTIVE`. A Law once `REVOKED` is dead and cannot be resurrected.

## Article IX. Expansion Prohibition (Feature Lock)
The Iron-5 Kernel is hereby declared **Feature Complete**. No further functional expansions to the Kernel Core are permitted. All future logic must be implemented as unprivileged Protocols (L4) or Application Logic (L7). The "Constitutional Boundary" is now closed.

## Article X. Finality
This document and the associated code in `src/L0` through `src/L6` constitute the complete and final architecture of the Iron Governance Kernel. 

**Date of Closure**: 2026-01-25
**Version**: 5.0.0 (FINAL)
