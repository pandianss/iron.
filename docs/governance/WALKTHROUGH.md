# Iron-5 Reference Kernel Implementation

This walkthrough demonstrates the successful implementation of the Iron-5 Reference Kernel Implementation Contract. The system has been refactored to enforce the Formal Execution Law, Centralized Identity Algebra, and the Protocol Sandbox.

## Key Accomplishments

### 1. Formal Execution Phase (L0-L3)
The `GovernanceKernel` now strictly follows the three-stage execution flow defined in Section 3:
- **`submitAttempt`**: Assigns a monotonic logical timestamp and unique ID.
- **`guardAttempt`**: Performs synchronous verification (Signature, Scope, Time, Budget) without side effects.
- **`commitAttempt`**: Implements a two-phase commit with dry-run validation to ensure atomicity.

### 2. Identity Algebra (L1)
Implemented the core components and invariants of the Iron-5 Identity system:
- **Capability Lattice**: Hierarchical permissions with wildcard support (`*`, `PREFIX:*`).
- **Identity Manager**: Enforces invariants I-1 to I-4 (Root immutability, No resurrection, Monotonicity, and Acyclic provenance).
- **Delegation Engine**: Implements `EffectiveScope` derivation and authority propagation logic.

### 3. Protocol Sandbox (L4)
Refactored the `ProtocolEngine` into a pure-evaluation model:
- **Predictive Evaluation**: Side-effects are calculated based on the predicted post-state of the primary intent.
- **Sandbox Isolation**: Protocols only return `Mutation` objects; they cannot directly modify the state.
- **Conflict Detection**: Detects multiple protocols targeting the same metric within a single atomic cycle.

### 4. Governance APIs
Integrated identity management into the Kernel as formal governance transitions:
- `createIdentity`
- `grantDelegation`
- `revokeIdentity`

### 4. Federation Bridge (L6)
Implemented a secure inter-kernel communication layer:
- **Trust Handshake**: Kernels register partners via public key binding.
- **Signed Attestations**: Outbound proofs are cryptographically sealed with the kernel's private key.
- **Shadow Identity**: Remote principals are represented locally using a namespaced identity (e.g., `KERNEL_A:alice`).

### 5. Application Layer (L7)
Implemented the user-facing interface through the `SovereignApp` controller:
- **Session Security**: Automated management of user keys and intent signing.
- **Action Mapping**: Simplified API for application developers to trigger complex kernel transitions.
- **Dashboard Aggregation**: Real-time view of reputation, commitment, and audit-linked history.
- **Audit Transparency**: Direct linking from UI actions to their immutable ledger proofs.

### 6. Constitutional Formalization (Phase 7)
The system's governing laws have been formally codified into the [Iron-5 Constitution](file:///C:/Users/sspan/.gemini/antigravity/brain/49ee65f8-3f29-4cd6-8e93-9589403f9e25/iron5_constitution.md):
- **Closed Governance**: Codifies the absolute supremacy of the Kernel execution law.
- **Identity Algebra Binding**: Formally binds the principal derivation rules to the constitutional text.
- **Hostile Review & Patching**: The constitution was subjected to a [Hostile Review](file:///C:/Users/sspan/.gemini/antigravity/brain/49ee65f8-3f29-4cd6-8e93-9589403f9e25/hostile_review.md), identifying 5 critical loopholes. All loopholes (Budget rebates, Genesis paradox, Shadow identity collision, etc.) have been patched.

## Verification Results

### Compliance, Federation & App (Section 7-9)
A dedicated compliance suite verifies the strict safety requirements of the contract:

| Requirement | Test ID | Description | Result |
| :--- | :--- | :--- | :---: |
| Authority Non-Escalation | `C-1` | Ensures actors cannot delegate scope they do not hold. | PASS |
| Revocation Propagation | `C-2` | Verifies that revoking a parent invalidates all descendant delegated authority. | PASS |
| Atomic Commit Safety | `C-3` | Proof that a crashing side-effect protocol rolls back the primary mutation. | PASS |
| Log Immutability | `C-4` | Detects tampering in the `AuditLog` through cryptographic hash linking. | PASS |
| Trust Handshake | `C-8` | Verify partner kernel registration and key binding. | PASS |
| Remote Attestation | `C-9` | Demonstrate Kernel B accepting a signed proof from Kernel A. | PASS |
| Tampering Detection | `C-10` | Prove that modified attestations are rejected. | PASS |
| **End-to-End Workflow** | `C-11` | Full user flow: Login -> Action -> Dashboard -> Audit Check. | PASS |
| **Session Isolation** | `C-12` | Rejects intents from unauthenticated or misconfigured sessions. | PASS |
| **Constitutional Law** | `C-13` | Formal verification of non-negotiable invariants (Budget/Revocation). | PASS |
